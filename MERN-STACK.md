 **The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Given the popularity of React on the frontend and of Node.js on the backend, the MERN stack is one of the most popular stack of technologies for building a modern single-page app.**
## MongoDB
___
 * _An open source document database that provides persistence for application data._
 * _Bridges the gap between key-value stores (**fast and scalable**) and relational databases ._
 * _Stores data as **JSON** documents in collections with dynamic schemas._
 * _pairs well with Node.js applications._
## Express web framework of Node.js
___
 * _provides routing and middleware_
 * _Basically runs the backend code as a module within the Node.js environment._
 * _Handles the routing of requests to the right parts of your app._
## React.js
___
 * _provides a dynamic frontend_
 * _A JavaScript library developed by Facebook to build interactive / reactive interfaces._
## Node.js
___
 * _A javascript runtime environment._
 * _**Asynchronous event-driven engine** - which means the app makes a request for some data and then performs other tasks while waiting for a response._
