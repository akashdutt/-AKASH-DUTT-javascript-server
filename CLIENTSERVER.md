___
 **The client-server model describes how a server provides resources and services to one or more clients. Examples of servers include web servers, mail servers, and file servers. Each of these servers provide resources to client devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Most servers have a one-to-many relationship with clients, meaning a single server can provide resources to multiple clients at one time.A client is any process that requests specific services from server processes.
A server is a process that provides requested services for clients.
Both clients and servers can reside in the same computer or in different computers connected by a network.**
## CLIENT
___
 _A client is the receiving end of a service or the requestor of a service in a client/server model type of system. The client is most often located on another system or computer, which can be accessed via a network._
## WEB SERVER
___
 _A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. Dedicated computers and appliances may be referred to as Web servers as well._

 _All computers that host Web sites must have Web server programs. Leading Web servers include **Apache** (the most widely-installed Web server), **Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS)** and **nginx** (pronounced engine X) from NGNIX. Other Web servers include **Novell's NetWare server**, **Google Web Server (GWS)** and **IBM's family of Domino servers.**_
## APPLICATION SERVER
___
 _An application server is a server program in a computer in a distributed network that provides the business logic for an application program. The application server is frequently viewed as part of a three-tier application, consisting of a graphical user interface (GUI) server, an application (business logic) server, and a database and transaction server._
 * _A **first-tier**, front-end, Web browser-based graphical user interface, usually at a personal computer or workstation_
 * _A **middle-tier** business logic application or set of applications, possibly on a local area network or intranet server_
 * _A **third-tier**, back-end, database and transaction server, sometimes on a mainframe or large server_
## Database Server
___
 _In the client-server computing model, there is a dedicated host to run and serve up the resources, typically one or more software applications. There are also several clients who can connect to the server and use the resources offered and hosted by this server.
When considering databases in the client-server model, the database server may be the back-end of the database application (the instance), or it may be the hardware computer that hosts the instance. It may even refer to the combination of both hardware and software.Database applications include **Oracle, DB2, Informix,Mongo DB and Microsoft SQL Server.**_
